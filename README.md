# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a website that allows two users to play tic tac toe against each other using the same browser. Player 1 clicks first, then player 2 clicks the board. The game will stop and declare a winner once a player has 3 in a row. If all squares are filled a draw will be declared. Players can play multiple games by clicking start new game button.

The site was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Json, and Ajax

I approached this project by mapping out the winning scenarios and looking at the API to understand I’ll need to pass the moves over in an array. I started by creating a game board and confirming that I could register a click. From there, I took steps to ensure the clicks enter an X or O on to the board and to enter that data into the game array which is sent to the API after each move.

I’d like to add a multiplayer aspect to the game in future iterations. This will allow two users to play each other from different browsers

My user stories are:
As a user I want to be able to login and track how many games I play
As a user I want to start a new game once my first game ends
As a user I want to see a message declaring the winner when a game ends
As a user I want the game to switch from x to o on each turn
